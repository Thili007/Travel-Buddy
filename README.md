Travel Buddy

Travel Buddy is a social media app that enables people to connect with each other based on their travel interests and locations. With this app, you can easily find like-minded travelers and explore different parts of the world together.

Technologies

This project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building full-stack web applications. We also use other technologies and libraries, such as Redux for state management, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and Material UI for the user interface.

Features

Travel Buddy has several features that make it a unique and valuable tool for travelers:

- Location-based search: Users can search for other travelers based on their location and travel preferences.
- Social networking: Users can create profiles, follow other users, and interact with them through posts and comments.
- Travel planning: Users can create and join travel plans, where they can coordinate with others and share trip details and photos.
- Real-time messaging: Users can communicate with each other in real-time through a messaging system built with Socket.IO.
